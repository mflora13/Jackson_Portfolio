## About Me
Hi! Welcome to my PERSONAL DATA SCIENCE PORTFOLIO website. My name is Jackson Yang. I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor degree in **Information Systems** and **Supply Chain Management**, and I am currently enrolled in the **MQM Program (master of quantitative management)** at Duke Fuqua where I am learning at the intersection of business and analytics to solve real world data-based business problem.

- In the **Projects** section, I listed a number of interesting data science projects I've completed in the past few years. In this repository, all projects (Class Project, Kaggle.com, etc.) are presented in iPython Notebooks, SQL and R markdown files.
- In the **Micro Projects** section, I highlighted the projects that demonstrate my programming abilities and data science expertise.
