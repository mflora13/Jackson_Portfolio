## About Me
Welcome to my personal data science portfolio website. My name is Jackson Yang and I am a recent graduate of the University of Washington with a bachelor's degree in **Business Administration and Information Systems**. I am currently enrolled in the **Master of Quantitative Management: Business Analytics** program at Duke Fuqua, where I am learning to utilize data analytics to solve real-world business problems. With my background in both business and data science, I am well-equipped to navigate the intersection of these fields and drive data-driven decision making in organizations.

- In the **Projects** section of this website, you will find a selection of interesting data science projects that I have completed in recent years. These projects are presented in iPython notebooks, SQL, or R markdown files for easy reference and review. Each project highlights my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, and demonstrates my ability to apply these skills to real-world scenarios.
- In the **Micro Projects** section, I highlighted the projects that demonstrate my programming abilities and data science expertise, such as SQL, data vivsualization, etc.

***Thank you for visiting my personal data science portfolio website.

## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/Self_Check_out.webp"> **[Self Check-Out Fraud Detection (Python) ](https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Self%20Checkout%20Fraud%20Detection/Code.ipynb)**

Self-checkout systems in retail stores offer convenience for customers, but can also leave retailers vulnerable to fraud if not properly monitored. A fraud detection model can help retailers identify suspicious activity and target certain purchases for additional scrutiny in order to prevent abuse and loss. In this project, we will aim to minimize the number of checks performed to avoid unnecessary expenses and to prevent falsely accusing innocent customers and causing them inconvenience.

Studying employee retention using machine learning helps businesses identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and develop strategies to improve retention. By analyzing data on employee demographics, job departments, and other factors, machine learning can identify patterns and trends that may be associated with higher or lower retention rates. This information can help businesses improve retention rates and create a more productive workforce.

At the end of the covid pandemic, it is anticipated that demand of air travel will increase significantly (Compared to the previous two years, I traveled significantly more in 2022 :)). So, how can airlines best position themselves for success after the pandemic? This project explores how airlines can maximize profits for each customer based on customer satisfaction prospects.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/ecommerce%20fraud.jpg"> **[eCommerce Fraud Detection (Python) ](https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/ecommerce%20Fraud%20Detection/Code.ipynb)**

Due to the enormous volume of online transactions, ecommerce businesses are especially prone to fraud. Fraud can cause a variety of problems for organizations and customers. Fraud detection systems can lower the probability of losses while also providing a safe environment for clients, increasing trust and happiness. In this project, I will create a model that can predict fraudulent activities while also explaining why the model made that conclusion.

[Dognition](https://www.dognition.com/)'s mission is to present you with an unprecedented perspective on how your dog sees the world through various coginitive traning exercises. DognitionÂ acquire and analyze tens of thousands of data everyday, but they are messey and require a significant amount of cleaning. In this project, I assisted them in cleaning up and gaining business insights from their datasets.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/conversion%20rate.png"> **[Customer Conversion Rate Analysis (Python) ](https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Conversion%20Rate/Code.ipynb)**

Conversion rate analysis can help businesses identify opportunities for growth. By identifying segments of the market that are more or less likely to convert, businesses can identify areas where they can focus their efforts in order to drive growth. In this project, we looked into a customer conversion dataset and help company increase the likelihood that their marketing and sales efforts will be successful.

The marketing department desires to understand the primary factors impacting the email click-through rate. I used logistic regression and decision trees primarily to validate the significance of each element and to assist the marketing department in determining when and how to send promotional emails to improve email marketing efficiency.

Funnel analysis helps understand the customer path and enhance conversions. Businesses may learn where users are sliding off a sales or conversion funnel by tracking their progress. This data can be utilized to optimize the funnel and improve conversion rates, boosting sales and income. In this project, we'll analyze a company's conversion funnel to discover bottlenecks and optimize the customer journey.
