## About Me
Hi! Welcome to my PERSONAL DATA SCIENCE PORTFOLIO website. My name is Jackson Yang. I graduated from the University of Washington with a bachelor degree in **Information Systems** and **Supply Chain Management**, and I am currently enrolled in the **MQM Program (master of quantitative management)** at Duke Fuqua where I am learning at the intersection of business and analytics to solve real world data-based business problem.

- In the **Projects** section, I listed a number of interesting data science projects I've completed in the past few years. In this repository, all projects (Class Project, Real World Project, Kaggle.com etc.) are presented in iPython Notebooks, SQL and R markdown files.
- In the **Micro Projects** section, I highlighted the projects that demonstrate my programming abilities and data science expertise.

The marketing department desires to understand the primary factors impacting the email click-through rate. I used logistic regression and decision trees primarily to validate the significance of each element and to assist the marketing department in determining when and how to send promotional emails to improve email marketing efficiency.

At the end of the covid pandemic, it is anticipated that demand of air travel will increase significantly (Compared to the previous two years, I traveled significantly more in 2022 :)). So, how can airlines best position themselves for success after the pandemic? This project explores how airlines can maximize profits for each customer based on customer satisfaction prospects.

[Dognition](https://www.dognition.com/)'s mission is to present you with an unprecedented perspective on how your dog sees the world through various coginitive traning exercises. DognitionÂ acquire and analyze tens of thousands of data everyday, but they are messey and require a significant amount of cleaning. In this project, I assisted them in cleaning up and gaining business insights from their datasets.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/blob/main/Images/conversion%20rate.png"> **[Customer Conversion Rate Analysis (Python) ](https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/Conversion%20Rate)**

Conversion rate analysis can help businesses identify opportunities for growth. By identifying segments of the market that are more or less likely to convert, businesses can identify areas where they can focus their efforts in order to drive growth. In this project, we looked into a customer conversion dataset and help company increase the likelihood that their marketing and sales efforts will be successful.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/main/Images/Employee-retention-rate-1000x553-1.webp"> **[Employee Retention Analysis (Python) ](https://github.com/YZXBiz/Jackson_Portfolio/tree/main/Projects/Employee%20Retention)**

Studying employee retention using machine learning helps businesses identify factors that contribute to employee turnover and develop strategies to improve retention. By analyzing data on employee demographics, job departments, and other factors, machine learning can identify patterns and trends that may be associated with higher or lower retention rates. This information can help businesses improve retention rates and create a more productive workforce.
